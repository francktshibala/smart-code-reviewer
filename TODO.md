# Smart Code Reviewer - Module 2 Implementation TODO

## Overview
This TODO tracks the implementation of Module 2: Cloud Databases integration for the Smart Code Reviewer project. Each task should be completed and tested before moving to the next.

## High Priority Tasks (Week 1)

### üèóÔ∏è Backend Infrastructure Setup
- [x] **Setup Backend Structure** 
  - Create `backend/` directory with proper TypeScript configuration
  - Install Express.js, TypeScript, and essential dependencies
  - Set up basic server structure with routing
  - Test: Server starts and responds to basic GET request

- [x] **Database Setup**
  - Create PostgreSQL database on Railway or Supabase
  - Configure environment variables for database connection
  - Test: Successfully connect to cloud database
  
- [ ] **Prisma ORM Setup**
  - Install and configure Prisma with PostgreSQL
  - Set up Prisma schema file
  - Test: Prisma can connect and introspect database

- [x] **Database Schema Design**
  - Create `users` table (id, email, password_hash, name, created_at)
  - Create `projects` table (id, user_id, name, description, created_at)
  - Create `analyses` table (id, project_id, filename, language, analysis_data, score, created_at)
  - Test: All tables created with proper relationships

## Medium Priority Tasks (Week 1-2)

### üîê Authentication System
- [ ] **Auth Endpoints**
  - Create POST /api/auth/register endpoint
  - Create POST /api/auth/login endpoint with JWT tokens
  - Add password hashing with bcrypt
  - Test: User can register and login successfully

- [ ] **Analysis API Endpoints**
  - Create POST /api/analyses endpoint to save analysis results
  - Create GET /api/analyses endpoint to retrieve user's analyses
  - Create GET /api/analyses/:id endpoint for single analysis
  - Test: Can save and retrieve analysis data

- [ ] **Project Management Endpoints**
  - Create POST /api/projects endpoint to create projects
  - Create GET /api/projects endpoint to list user's projects
  - Create PUT /api/projects/:id endpoint to update projects
  - Test: Users can organize analyses into projects

### üîó Frontend Integration
- [ ] **Authentication Integration**
  - Add login/register forms to existing frontend
  - Implement JWT token storage and management
  - Add protected route logic
  - Test: Complete auth flow works in UI

- [ ] **Persistence Integration**
  - Modify existing analysis components to save results after analysis
  - Add "Save Analysis" functionality to current workflow
  - Ensure existing analysis still works without saving
  - Test: Users can analyze code and optionally save results

- [ ] **Dashboard Component**
  - Create user dashboard showing saved analyses
  - Display analysis history with basic statistics
  - Add project organization view
  - Test: Users can view their saved work

## Low Priority Tasks (Week 2)

### üîç Advanced Features
- [ ] **Search and Filtering**
  - Add search functionality for saved analyses
  - Implement filters by date range, language, and score
  - Add pagination for large result sets
  - Test: Users can find specific analyses quickly

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
  - Implement connection pooling
  - Add basic caching for dashboard data
  - Test: System performs well with multiple users

### üöÄ Testing and Deployment
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - Test that all existing functionality still works
  - Test complete user journey from registration to analysis
  - Fix any breaking changes
  - Test: System works end-to-end

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - Deploy backend to cloud platform
  - Update frontend to use production API endpoints
  - Configure production environment variables
  - Test: Production system works correctly

## Testing Strategy for Each Task

Each task should include these verification steps:
1. **Unit Test**: Does the individual component work?
2. **Integration Test**: Does it work with existing code?
3. **User Test**: Can a user complete the intended workflow?
4. **Regression Test**: Does existing functionality still work?

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backup Strategy**: Create git branch before each major change
- **Incremental Approach**: Keep existing frontend working while adding backend
- **Fallback Plan**: If authentication is too complex, implement just save/load first
- **Daily Goals**: Complete at least one testable task per day

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Existing code analysis functionality unchanged
- ‚úÖ Users can create accounts and login
- ‚úÖ Users can save and retrieve analysis results
- ‚úÖ Users can organize analyses into projects
- ‚úÖ System works with multiple users simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Data persists between sessions
