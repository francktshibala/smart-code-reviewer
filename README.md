# Smart Code Reviewer

## CSE 310 Module 1: TypeScript Learning Project

### Course Context
I built this project for my CSE 310 class as Module 1. The goal was to learn TypeScript from scratch and build something real with it. I had never used TypeScript before this class - only JavaScript. I had one week to learn it and create this application.

### Module Requirements Met
âœ… **Made my own software**: I created an AI code reviewer tool (didn't follow any tutorial)  
âœ… **Learned TypeScript**: Used TypeScript features I never knew before  
âœ… **Added good comments**: Every function has comments explaining what it does  
âœ… **Made this README**: Complete documentation with setup steps  
âœ… **Made a demo video**: 4-5 minute video showing how it works and explaining my code  
âœ… **Put it on GitHub**: Public repository that anyone can see  

### How I Learned TypeScript (1 Week Sprint)

**Days 1-2: Learning the Basics**
I followed the course research method:

1. **Official TypeScript Docs**: Read the TypeScript handbook to understand types and interfaces
2. **Background Research**: Used Wikipedia to understand what static typing means
3. **YouTube Tutorials**: Watched beginner TypeScript videos to see real examples
4. **AI Help**: Asked ChatGPT and Claude questions when I got confused

**Days 3-5: Building the Project**
Started coding:
- Made file upload that works with different code files
- Built code analysis that finds problems in code
- Connected everything with proper TypeScript types
- Made the user interface look good

**Days 6-7: Finishing Up**
- Added comments to all my code
- Wrote this documentation
- Made the demo video
- Fixed any bugs I found

### Why I Picked TypeScript

**For the class**: TypeScript was completely new to me. I only knew JavaScript before CSE 310.

**For my career**: TypeScript is used everywhere in modern web development. Learning it makes me more employable.

**For this project**: Building a code analysis tool needed TypeScript's type safety to handle different programming languages without crashing.

### What I Learned

**TypeScript Skills I Got:**
- How to define custom types for my data
- How to make functions that work with different types safely
- How to catch errors before the code runs
- How to organize code better with interfaces
- How to connect to APIs without breaking things

**Problems I Solved:**
- **Type Confusion**: At first, TypeScript felt limiting coming from JavaScript. I learned types actually prevent bugs.
- **API Integration**: Had trouble typing API responses safely. I figured out how to handle optional data properly.
- **Code Organization**: Learned how to split code into modules that work together.

### Time Spent
**Total**: 14 hours in 1 week
- Learning TypeScript: 4 hours
- Building the app: 8 hours  
- Testing and docs: 2 hours

This is more than the required 12 hours for the module.

### Academic Reflection

This project shows I can learn a new programming language quickly and build something useful with it. In one week, I went from never using TypeScript to making a working application that uses advanced TypeScript features.

The hardest part was understanding how types work, but once I got it, my code became much more reliable. This will help me in future modules where I need to build bigger, more complex systems.

## Overview
Smart Code Reviewer is a web app that looks at your code and tells you how to make it better. It uses AI to give you suggestions, just like having an experienced programmer review your work.

## Why I Built This
As a student learning to code, I write code that works but could be better. I wanted a tool that would catch my mistakes and teach me better ways to write code. This also helps me learn about AI development, which is where I want my career to go.

## Purpose
I made this for CSE 310 to show I can use TypeScript well. The app solves a real problem that developers face - getting good feedback on their code.

## Features
- **Works with many languages**: Checks TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, and Rust files
- **Gives you metrics**: Tells you how complex your code is and how many lines you have
- **AI suggestions**: Uses smart algorithms to suggest improvements
- **Finds problems**: Spots security issues, overly complex code, and style problems
- **Makes reports**: You can download a professional report of the analysis
- **Easy to use**: Just drag and drop your files
- **Shows progress**: You can see the analysis happening in real time
- **Works everywhere**: Works on computers and phones

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript 5.3+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for nice design
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent icons
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development
- **Code Analysis**: My own TypeScript-based analysis system
- **AI Integration**: Ready to connect to OpenAI API

## TypeScript Features I Used
- **Type Safety**: Custom interfaces and union types to prevent errors
- **Generic Programming**: Functions that work with multiple types safely
- **Utility Types**: Advanced TypeScript features like Record and Extract
- **Error Handling**: Proper async/await with typed error handling
- **Modular Code**: Clean code organization with TypeScript modules
- **API Integration**: Type-safe connections to external services

## Installation and Setup

### What You Need
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A modern web browser

### How to Install
```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/francktshibala/smart-code-reviewer
cd smart-code-reviewer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## How to Use

### Basic Steps
1. **Upload a File**: Drag and drop a code file or click to browse
2. **Wait for Analysis**: The app will look at your code and create metrics
3. **Check Results**: Look at the score, metrics, suggestions, and issues
4. **Download Report**: Get a complete analysis report

### File Types That Work
- `.ts` - TypeScript files
- `.js` - JavaScript files  
- `.py` - Python files
- `.java` - Java files
- `.go` - Go files
- `.rs` - Rust files

## Problems I Solved

### Problem 1: Learning TypeScript Types
**What went wrong**: Coming from JavaScript, TypeScript's strict typing felt weird and hard.
**How I fixed it**: I practiced with small examples in TypeScript Playground before using them in my real project. I learned that types actually help prevent bugs.

### Problem 2: Making Code Analysis Work
**What went wrong**: Building a code analyzer is really hard. I couldn't build a full parser.
**How I fixed it**: I made a simpler system using patterns and line-by-line checking. It's not perfect but it gives useful feedback.

### Problem 3: Making It Easy to Use
**What went wrong**: Showing complex analysis data in a simple way was challenging.
**How I fixed it**: I showed the most important stuff first (the score) then let users click to see more details.

## What I Learned

### TypeScript Skills
- **Type System**: I understand how TypeScript's types work, including interfaces and union types
- **Error Handling**: I know how to handle errors properly with async/await
- **Code Structure**: I can organize code well with TypeScript modules
- **Type Safety**: I experienced how TypeScript prevents bugs and makes code more reliable

### Programming Skills
- **Code Quality**: I understand what makes code good or bad (complexity, maintainability)
- **Static Analysis**: I learned how to analyze code automatically
- **User Experience**: I can design interfaces that are easy to use
- **Professional Development**: I built something I actually use for my own projects

## Demo Video
[ðŸŽ¥ Watch my demo video](https://youtu.be/KD7koB-YOxw?si=pBfDcpWxEqZ4L-f7)

The video shows:
- How the whole app works
- Me analyzing real code files
- My TypeScript code and how it works
- What I learned and problems I solved

## Future Improvements
- **Real AI**: Connect to OpenAI GPT-4 for smarter suggestions
- **Multiple Files**: Let people analyze many files at once
- **Custom Rules**: Let users set their own code standards
- **Team Features**: Let teams share analyses and work together
