4.	Complete the following checklist to make sure you completed all parts of the module.  Mark your response with “Yes” or “No”.  If the answer is “No” then additionally describe what was preventing you from completing this step.
Question	Your Response
Did you implement the entire set of unique requirements as described in the Module Description document in I-Learn?
List each requirement from the requirements document and mark if you completed it with a yes or no.	
All Basic Requirements	Complete
1.Write software of your own creation (not tutorial code)	Yes
2. All code documented with useful comments	Yes
3. README.md file at top folder with complete template	Yes
4. 4-5 minute video with talking head demonstrating software and code	Yes
5. Video must include image of you presenting (required for accreditation)	Yes
6. Publish in public GitHub repository	Yes
7. Repository name reflects software/technology (not generic names)	Yes
8. TypeScript Specific Requirement Complete	Yes
One Additional Requirement	Yes
1. Demonstrate advanced TypeScript features and type safety	Yes

Did you write at least 100 lines of code in your software and include function level comments on all the functions you wrote?
	Yes ,The project contains over 500 lines of TypeScript code with comprehensive comments explaining the purpose and implementation of each function, especially in the CodeAnalysisService and type definitions.
Did you use the correct README.md template from the Module Description document in I-Learn?
	Yes , Used the TypeScript module README template and filled out all required sections.
Did you completely populate the README.md template?
	Yes ,  All sections are complete including overview, technology stack, TypeScript features, installation instructions, usage examples, challenges faced, and learning outcomes.
Did you create the video that includes you in a window, and reference it in the README.md file?	Yes, Created a 4-5 minute video showing my face during presentation, demonstrating the application, and explaining TypeScript concepts. Link is included in README.md.
Did you post a link to your video in the proper MS Teams Channel?	Yes , Posted video link in the TypeScript module channel in Microsoft Teams.
Did you publish the code with the README.md (in the top-level folder) into a public GitHub repository?
	Yes , Repository is public at github.com/francoisthibala/smart-code-reviewer with README.md in the root directory.


5.	How many hours did you spend on this module this Sprint?  Include all time including planning, researching, implementation, troubleshooting, documentation, video production, and publishing.  
Record your total time here: 22 hours

Paste your time log here including time spent each day on your project:

•	Week 1: 
•	Monday (2 hours): Research TypeScript documentation, set up development environment
•	Tuesday (2 hours): Planned project architecture, created initial type definitions
•	Wednesday (2 hours): Built basic UI components and file upload functionality
•	Thursday (2 hours): Implemented core TypeScript interfaces and service patterns
•	Friday (2 hours): Started code analysis logic and metrics calculation
•	Saturday (1 hour): Caught up on documentation and planning
•	Week 2: 
•	Monday (3 hours): Completed code analysis service with advanced TypeScript features
•	Tuesday (2 hours): Refined UI/UX, added error handling and loading states
•	Wednesday (3 hours): Testing, debugging, and polishing the application
•	Thursday (2 hours): Wrote comprehensive README.md and code documentation
•	Friday (2 hours): Recorded demo video and prepared final submission
•	Saturday (1 hour): Final review and submission preparation



6.	What learning strategies worked well in this module and what strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?  How can you improve in the next module?
Strategies that didn't work well:
•	Initial Over-Ambition: I initially planned to integrate with OpenAI's API but realized it would take away focus from TypeScript learning. I should have started simpler.
•	Perfectionism: I spent too much time trying to make the code "perfectly TypeScript-y" instead of getting a working version first, then refining.
•	Scattered Research: I jumped between multiple learning resources instead of following one comprehensive path initially.
Improvements for next module (Cloud Databases):
•	MVP First: Build a minimal working version before adding advanced features
•	Structured Learning Path: Choose one primary resource and stick with it before exploring alternatives
•	Weekly Check-ins: Implement formal weekly reviews to catch scope creep early
•	Time Boxing: Set strict time limits for research phases to force decision-making
•	Integration Planning: Since Module 2 will build on this project, I'll plan the database integration architecture from the start to avoid refactoring
